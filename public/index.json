First of all, the proportion of Roman Catholics in the United States has declined rapidly over this period. From a a high of about 45% of the US population, the proportion of Catholics sank to about 25% in mid 1990s. Due to Latin American immigration, the proportion of Catholics have increased since the 1990s to about 30%.\nSecond, there has been a very steep rise in the number of people claiming no religious affiliation. Non-affliates were a pretty steady 8% of the US population from the early 1970s to the early 1990s. The proportion of nones has climbed steeply since then, reaching a high of 25% of the US population, making them the second largest “religious” group in the United States.\nThird, there is some strangeness in these data from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s. Over this period, there is a fairly large increase in the proportion of the population classified as Mainline Protestant. It is not clear if this is a problem with the denominational classification system in the GSS or if it reflects real growth. My suspicion is that this is an issue with the way denomination was coded over this period and not a real increase in the proportion of Mainline Protestants in the US.\nAlso important is that the “Other” religion category is steadily climbing, and has reached a high of about 5% of the US population. Conservative Protestants also seem to be on the decline. In the last two waves of the GSS they are at an all-time low of about 18%.\n  ","date":1547510400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1547510400,"objectID":"0492b552822a1b2042d9700dab93c4a2","permalink":"/post/reltrad-in-the-us/","publishdate":"2019-01-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/reltrad-in-the-us/","section":"post","summary":"Religious Affiliation According to Reltrad How the United States has Changed Religiously 1972-2016 In a previous post I generated the code to create the reltrad variable in the General Social Survey.

Well, today is your lucky day.\nThe measure of religious affiliation described in (Steensland et al. 2000), otherwise known as reltrad, remains the most popular way to categorize people religiously in the United States. Early development of the measure was done by Corwin Smidt, Bud Kellstedt and James Guth during their annual seminars on measuring religion offered at Calvin College. The reltrad crowd continues to think their measure is pretty good (Woodberry et al. 2012). A reltrad for African Americans has been developed - this is required reading for those who use reltrad in their research (Shelton and Cobb 2017).\nUp until now, the code to create the reltrad variable from the General Social Survey has only been available in PDF. Stata code for reltrad is available from Lifeway Research. Lifeway also published R code.\nHere, I am providing an additional R translation of the code that is more reproducible and up on Github for the community to use easily. I apply this to the 1972-2016 GSS combined data file. Note that I do incorporate the corrections suggested by (Stetzer and Burge 2016).\nThis code takes a GSS datafile and then recodes religious affiliation into the reltrad scheme created by Steensland et al. It breaks the US population into Conservative Protestant, Mainline Protestant, Black Protestant, Jewish, Other, and Non-Affiliated.\nI’ve written this code in vanilla R, but resorted to the car package for easier recoding. The code is pretty well commented, but tweet at me or email me if you have questions. It’s also bad code that I wrote a long while ago. I’d do this differently with dplyr.\nFirst, here’s how to get the NORC data down:\n#Not run #Get the GSS data, import into a temp file and unzip #read in the GSS data #Convert to R data format #Save library(dplyr) temp \u0026lt;- tempfile() download.file(\u0026quot;http://gss.norc.org/documents/stata/GSS_stata.zip\u0026quot;,temp) unzip(temp, files=\u0026quot;GSS7216_R4.DTA\u0026quot;,exdir = \u0026quot;OrigData\u0026quot;) unlink(temp);rm(temp) gss = haven::read_dta(\u0026quot;OrigData/GSS7216_R4.DTA\u0026quot;) save(gss, file = file) #Load the data load(file) # #Get the variables we want, this is a huge dataset. gss = gss %\u0026gt;% select(relig, other, race, denom, year, attend, id, wtss) save(gss, file=file) Now, here is the full code to create reltrad in R.

They had greater body mass index, higher prevalence of diabetes and hypertension, and lower physical health functioning. White clergy reported less favorable mental health. They had higher severity of depression and anxiety symptoms as well as lower quality of life and mental health functioning. Propensity score analysis revealed that matching on SES and other key variables accounted for most, but not all, of the observed racial differences. Racial disparities in hypertension, depression severity, and mental health functioning persisted despite adjustments. Conclusions Race contributed to health disparities in some outcomes in our study population, above and beyond our measures of participants’ present SES and key demographic, occupational, and physical activity variables. This study provides evidence supporting the position that race contributes to health disparities through pathways other than SES.","tags":[],"title":"Disentangling Race and Socioeconomic Status in HealthDisparities Research: an Examination of Black and White Clergy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Eagle","Lisa A.

To test this theory, we used survey data from the Clergy Health Initiative Panel Survey to examine the relationship between perceived and received social support and their association with depressive symptoms in clergy (N ¼ 1,288). Overall, analyses revealed perceived support had a weak association with received support. Greater perceived support had a significant relationship with lower depressive symptoms. In contrast, greater received support had only a small relationship with lower depressive symptoms, which was fully mediated by perceived support. Our results raise questions about the effectiveness of many clergy social support interventions, which often aim to boost the quality and/or quantity of received social support. We suggest it may be more advantageous to boost perceptions of social support, possibly through cognitive reframing or positive mental health interventions.","tags":[],"title":"Perceived social support, received social support, and depression among clergy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rae Jean Proeschold-Bell","Elizabeth L.

Design: An RCT using a three-cohort multiple baseline design was conducted in 2010–2014. Setting/participants: Participants were United Methodist clergy in North Carolina, U.S., in 2010, invited based on occupational status. Of invited 1,745 clergy, 1,114 consented, provided baseline data, and were randomly assigned to immediate intervention (n¼395), 1-year waitlist (n¼283), or 2-year waitlist (n¼436) cohorts for a 48-month trial duration. Intervention: The 2-year intervention consisted of personal goal setting and encouragement to engage in monthly health coaching, an online weight loss intervention, a small grant, and three workshops delivering stress management and theological content supporting healthy behaviors. Participants were not blinded to intervention. Main outcome measures: Trial outcomes were metabolic syndrome (primary) and self-reported stress and depressive symptoms (secondary). Intervention effects were estimated in 2016 in an intention-to-treat framework using generalized estimating equations with adjustment for baseline level of the outcome and follow-up time points. Log-link Poisson generalized estimating equations with robust SEs was used to estimate prevalence ratios (PRs) for binary outcomes; mean differences were used for continuous/score outcomes. Results: Baseline prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 50.9\\% and depression was 11.4\\%. The 12-month intervention effect showed a beneﬁt for metabolic syndrome (PR¼0.86, 95\\% CI¼0.79, 0.94, po0.001). This beneﬁt was sustained at 24 months of intervention (PR¼0.88; 95\\% CI¼0.78, 1.00, p¼0.04). There was no signiﬁcant effect on depression or stress scores. Conclusions: The Spirited Life intervention improved metabolic syndrome prevalence in a population of U.S. Christian clergy and sustained improvements during 24 months of intervention. These ﬁndings offer support for long-duration behavior change interventions and population-level interventions that allow participants to set their own health goals.","tags":[],"title":"A 2-Year Holistic Health and Stress Intervention: Results of an RCT in Clergy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Timothy W.

Contrary to expectations, we ﬁnd that mental distress decreased for those who recently moved compared to those who had moved 2 years prior. We also ﬁnd strong evidence of a ‘‘honeymoon effect.’’ Recently relocated clergy report higher levels of self-efﬁcacy and higher workplace morale compared to those who do not relocate.

With the rapid growth of megachurches in the United States, a negative relationship between size and frequency of attendance could serve to accelerate aggregate declines in attendance.

This study adds to current knowledge by examining the impact of British Columbia’s Agricultural Land Reserve (ALR), established in 1973, which severely restricts subdivision and nonagricultural uses for more than 4.7 million hectares of farmland. To determine the extent to which the ALR preserves farmland by reducing or removing the development option, a multilevel hedonic pricing model is used to estimate the impact of land use, geographic, and zoning characteristics on farmland value near the capital city of Victoria on Vancouver Island. Using sales data from 1974 through 2008, the model demonstrates a changing ALR impact over time that varies considerably by improved and unimproved land types. In 2008, landowners paid 19\\% less for the typical improved farmland parcel within the ALR versus that outside it. This suggests that would-be developers expect permanency in the zoning law, and prefer non-ALR zoned land. However, ALR land that is unimproved has a premium of 55\\%, suggesting that this land is more valuable for agriculture than for development. Farmland located closer to the city or the commuting highway commands a premium if it has a residence on it, with a residence also explaining why smaller agricultural properties sell at higher prices. However, it appears that zoning by itself is insufﬁcient to protect farmland; other policies likely need to be implemented in conjunction with zoning to protect agricultural land.","tags":[],"title":"Farmland Protection and Agricultural Land Values at the Urban-Rural Fringe: British Columbia’s Agricultural Land Reserve","type":"publication"},{"authors":["D.

Contrary to this position, this research demonstrates that megachurches enjoy a long history in Protestantism. An important example from the 16th Century Huguenot architect Jacques Perret reveals an early Protestant vision for a large, multi-functional worship space. Soon after, this vision became realized in bricks and mortar. Revivalism and the Institutional Church Movement of the 19th and early 20th Centuries provide further connections between megachurches and the past. Revivalism provided the motivation for Protestants to go out and reach the masses, and the Institutional Church Movement provided the infrastructure to attract, convert, and nurture them. The demographic shifts that occurred following WWII led to the proliferation of churches in post-war America. This meant that large churches became increasingly visible, but journalists and social commentators mistook their increase in prevalence for lack of historical precedent. Pastors and other leaders, capitalizing on the appeal of innovation, reinforced this view. This research offers an important corrective that helps situate megachurches in the United States in their proper context.","tags":[],"title":"Historicizing the Megachurch","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David E.

Approximately half of this decline stems from the increase in the proportion of people reporting no religion, who, for the most part, do not attend religious services. The other portion of this decline is attributable to eroding attendance rates among Catholics, particularly older Catholics, and Protestants in Que´bec. Attendance rates for Protestants outside of Que´bec show signs of increase. The reported increase in weekly attendance in Canada by the Project Canada surveys and cited by Bibby as a possible indicator of a religious renaissance is revealed as an artifact in the data due to an oversample of Protestants. I ﬁnd another weighting problem in the Canadian Survey of Giving, Volunteering and Participating that leads to underestimates of aggregate religious attendance rates.","tags":[],"title":"Changing Patterns of Attendance at Religious Services in Canada, 1986-2008","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jen'nan G.

We build on and extend this argument by focusing on intersecting group identities as a mechanism for identifying such incongruence, not only within religious contexts, but also at the intersection of categories such as gender and race. To illustrate this argument, the analysis draws on data from the 2006 Panel Study of American Religion and Ethnicity (PS-ARE) to assess how race, gender, and religion interact to produce different levels of attitude and behavior incongruencies on key issues of the day, speciﬁcally conservative social values and voting behaviors. The results ﬁnd marked differences and inconsistent relationships between attitudes and behaviors across racial-gender groups. We use the analysis to highlight the conditions that result in incongruence at the intersections of identity categories and pinpoint where social scientists are most vulnerable to committing the congruence fallacy.","tags":[],"title":"Intersecting Identities as a Source of Religious Incongruence","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Eagle"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1293840000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1293840000,"objectID":"64a2875617f67180eea2cd4cae0cc204","permalink":"/publication/2011-01-01_eagle_loosening_2011/","publishdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2011-01-01_eagle_loosening_2011/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"The Loosening Bond of Religion on Canadian Society: Reply to Bibby","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Eagle"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1262304000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1262304000,"objectID":"13a5cc097ad1ae72035a6870fddb54cb","permalink":"/publication/2010-01-01_eagle_pneumatological_2010/","publishdate":"2010-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2010-01-01_eagle_pneumatological_2010/","section":"publication","summary":"The debate surrounding the morality of homosexual marriage is one of the most charged and fractious in the church today. As local congregations, national denominations, and international affiliations of Christians wrestle with this issue, significant conflict and division has arisen and continues to rage. At the center of this debate are so-called “arguments from creation,” that is, arguments that look to the natural or revealed “order of things” to discern God’s design for appropriate sexual behavior. This mode of theological argumentation has a long history in the tradition of natural theology, which assumes that divine direction (and even divine speech) is inherent in creaturely capacities. In this article, I will demonstrate that New Testament scholarship is agreed that in Romans 1:18-32 (the key NT text on the issue), Paul is not making an argument per se against homosexuality. Instead, this passage fits within the larger claim that he is trying to make throughout the book of Romans about Jew-Gentile relations. What Paul condemns here is the human propensity to judge others based on supposedly intrinsic qualities. He is using a stereotypical Jewish understanding of Gentiles, and turning it back against those who would argue for some special innate characteristic within Jews that makes them special and within Gentiles that makes them depraved.","tags":[],"title":"Pneumatological Ecclesiology and Same-sex Marriage: A Non-essentialist Approach Using the Work of Eugene Rogers and John Zizioulas","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David E.

Mennonite theology, with its emphasis on a theology of peace, shares similar concerns. J. Denny Weaver takes issue with the dominance of the Anselmian satisfaction theory, particularly because of its inherent violence.1 In The Nonviolent Atonement, he articulates a view that “charts a path of nonviolent atonement through territory strewn with images and assumptions of violence.”2 He argues for narrative Christus Victor as a superior and inherently nonviolent atonement motif. However, I challenge Weaver’s claim. I contend that Mennonite theologians would find better resources for articulating a nonviolent approach in the work of Anthony Bartlett in his recent book, Cross Purposes: The Violent Grammar of Christian Atonement. Below I will raise questions about Weaver’s work and attempt to explain how Bartlett’s paradigm offers a better approach.","tags":[],"title":"Anthony Bartlett’s Concept of Abyssal Compassion and the Possibility of a Truly Nonviolent Atonement","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Welcome to Slides Academic\nFeatures  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides  Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E  Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = \\;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \nA fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears  Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view   Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links   night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links  Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/img/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?
