First of all, the proportion of Roman Catholics in the United States has stayed relatively steady over this period. While Latin American immigration has brought a lot of new Catholics to the United States, this has been offset by losses among the non-hispanic Catholic population.\nSecond, there has been a very steep rise in the number of people claiming no religious affiliation. Non-affliates were a pretty steady 5-8% of the US population from the early 1970s to the early 1990s. The proportion of nones has climbed steeply since then, reaching a high of 25% of the US population, making them the second largest “religious” group in the United States. They could very well surpass Catholics by the time the next wave of GSS data are released.\nThe higher proportion Black Protestant in 1972 is probably due to some sort of artifact in the GSS data. There seems to be a lower proportion of Conservative Protestants that year as well. This blip is also found on other plots of GSS reltrad data, here, for example.\nThird, Mainline Protestants are in free fall. They are now about 12% of the US population, down about 20 points from their peak in the early 1970s. Conservative Protestants made some gains in the mid-1980s to mid-1990s (probably due to people leaving mainline denominations over cultural issues), but are also declining. They are down about 10 points from their high in the early 1990s.\nAlso important is that the “Other” religion category is steadily climbing, and has reached a high of about 5% of the US population. The proportion of the population identifying as Black Protestants remained fairly steady over this period, but recently has begun to decline.\n  ","date":1547510400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1547510400,"objectID":"0492b552822a1b2042d9700dab93c4a2","permalink":"/post/reltrad-in-the-us/","publishdate":"2019-01-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/reltrad-in-the-us/","section":"post","summary":"Religious Affiliation According to Reltrad How the United States has Changed Religiously 1972-2016 In a previous post I generated the code to create the reltrad variable in the General Social Survey.

Research has focused on the absence or presence of mental health problems, such as depression, in caregivers. However, positive mental health – defined as the presence of positive emotions, psychological functioning, and social functioning – likely prevents depression and in caregivers may benefit children more than the mere absence of mental health problems. Little attention has been given to how caregivers sustain positive mental health, particularly when doing challenging work in impoverished settings. Objective: The study's objective was to determine what successful caregivers of orphaned and vulnerable children (OVC) in diverse countries do to sustain their positive mental health. Methods: Using a mixed-methods, cross-sectional study design, trained local interviewers recruited a convenience sample of OVC caregivers through residential care institutions from five geographic regions (Kenya; Ethiopia; Cambodia; Hyderabad, India; and Nagaland, India). Participants completed surveys and in-depth interviews about strategies used to sustain their mental health over time or improve it during challenging times. Results: Sixty-nine OVC caregivers from 28 residential care institutions participated. Positive mental health survey scores were high. We organized the strategies named into six categories ordered from most to least frequently named: Religious Practices; Engaging in Caregiving; Social Support; Pleasurable Activities; Emotion Regulation; and Removing Oneself from Work. Prayer and reading religious texts arose as common strategies. Participants reported promoting positive emotions by focusing on their work's meaning and playing with children. The similar findings across diverse regions were striking. Some differences included more emphasis on emotion control in Ethiopia; listening to music/singing in Kenya and Hyderabad; and involving children in the tasks the participants enjoyed less (e.g., cleaning) in Cambodia. Conclusions: Under real-world conditions, small daily activities appeared to help sustain positive mental health. In addition, fostering structures that allow caregivers to engage regularly in rewarding caregiving tasks may be an affordable and scalable idea which could potentially benefit caregivers, children, and employers.","tags":[],"title":"Caring and Thriving: An International Qualitative Study of Caregivers of Orphaned and Vulnerable Children and Strategies to Sustain Positive Mental Health.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David E.

We conducted qualitative interviews of 69 caregivers in four countries: Ethiopia, Kenya, Cambodia, and India (Hyderabad and Nagaland), and across four religious traditions: Christian (Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and Protestant), Muslim, Buddhist, and Hindu. We asked respondents to describe the importance of religion for their becoming a caregiver, the way in which religion has helped them make sense of why children are orphans, and how religion helps them face the challenges of their occupation. Using qualitative descriptive analysis, three major themes emerged. Respondents discussed how religion provided a strong motivation for their work, reported that religious institutions were often the way in which they were introduced to caregiving as an occupation, and spoke of the ways religious practices sustain them in their work. They rarely advanced religion as an explanation for why OVC exist—only when pressed did they offer explicitly religious accounts. This study has implications for OVC care, including the importance of engaging religious institutions to support caregivers, the significance of attending to local religious context, and the vital need for research outside of Christian contexts.","tags":[],"title":"Religion and Caregiving for Orphans and Vulnerable Children: A Qualitative Study of Caregivers Across Four Religious Traditions and Five Global Contexts","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jennifer Lutz","David E.

Well, today is your lucky day.\nThe measure of religious affiliation described in (Steensland et al. 2000), otherwise known as reltrad, remains the most popular way to categorize people religiously in the United States. Early development of the measure was done by Corwin Smidt, Bud Kellstedt and James Guth during their annual seminars on measuring religion offered at Calvin College. The reltrad crowd continues to think their measure is pretty good (Woodberry et al. 2012). A reltrad for African Americans has been developed - this is required reading for those who use reltrad in their research (Shelton and Cobb 2017).\nUp until now, the code to create the reltrad variable from the General Social Survey has only been available in PDF. Stata code for reltrad is available from Lifeway Research. Lifeway also published R code. Ryan Burge has Stata code up on Github: https://github.com/ryanburge/reltrad.\nHere, I am providing a link to my repository with an R translation of the code that is more reproducible. I apply this to the 1972-2016 GSS combined data file. Note that I do incorporate the corrections suggested by (Stetzer and Burge 2016).\nThe code takes a GSS datafile and then recodes religious affiliation into the reltrad scheme created by Steensland et al. It breaks the US population into Conservative Protestant, Mainline Protestant, Black Protestant, Jewish, Other, and Non-Affiliated.\nI’ve written this code in vanilla R, but resorted to the car package for easier recoding. The code is pretty well commented, but tweet at me or email me if you have questions. It’s also bad code that I wrote a long while ago. I’d do this differently with dplyr.\nFirst, here’s how to get the NORC data down:\n#Not run #Get the GSS data, import into a temp file and unzip #read in the GSS data #Convert to R data format #Save library(dplyr) temp \u0026lt;- tempfile() download.file(\u0026quot;http://gss.norc.org/documents/stata/GSS_stata.zip\u0026quot;,temp) unzip(temp, files=\u0026quot;GSS7216_R4.DTA\u0026quot;,exdir = \u0026quot;OrigData\u0026quot;) unlink(temp);rm(temp) gss = haven::read_dta(\u0026quot;OrigData/GSS7216_R4.DTA\u0026quot;) #Load the data # #Get the variables we want, this is a huge dataset. #Save where you like: file = \u0026quot;OrigData/gss7216.data\u0026quot; gss = gss %\u0026gt;% select(relig, other, race, denom, year, attend, id, wtssall, sample) save(gss, file=file) names(gss) The full code to create reltrad in R lives here.\nAfter the code is run, the results can be quickly tabulated. The following table looks at how the religious composition of the US has changed over time. This uses the very useful wrapper crosstab( ) for the CrossTable( ) function in the package descr. It allows you to make weighted crosstabs easily and prettily. In subsequent posts, I will have some fun with ggplot to visual these data.\n## @knitr ReltradTable library(descr) print( crosstab(gss$year,gss$reltrad, weight = gss$wtssall, prop.c = T, prop.r = T, prop.t = F, total.c = F, plot = F)) ##

They had greater body mass index, higher prevalence of diabetes and hypertension, and lower physical health functioning. White clergy reported less favorable mental health. They had higher severity of depression and anxiety symptoms as well as lower quality of life and mental health functioning. Propensity score analysis revealed that matching on SES and other key variables accounted for most, but not all, of the observed racial differences. Racial disparities in hypertension, depression severity, and mental health functioning persisted despite adjustments. Conclusions Race contributed to health disparities in some outcomes in our study population, above and beyond our measures of participants’ present SES and key demographic, occupational, and physical activity variables.

Overall, analyses revealed perceived support had a weak association with received support. Greater perceived support had a significant relationship with lower depressive symptoms. In contrast, greater received support had only a small relationship with lower depressive symptoms, which was fully mediated by perceived support.

Design: An RCT using a three-cohort multiple baseline design was conducted in 2010–2014. Setting/participants: Participants were United Methodist clergy in North Carolina, U.S., in 2010, invited based on occupational status. Of invited 1,745 clergy, 1,114 consented, provided baseline data, and were randomly assigned to immediate intervention (n¼395), 1-year waitlist (n¼283), or 2-year waitlist (n¼436) cohorts for a 48-month trial duration. Intervention: The 2-year intervention consisted of personal goal setting and encouragement to engage in monthly health coaching, an online weight loss intervention, a small grant, and three workshops delivering stress management and theological content supporting healthy behaviors. Participants were not blinded to intervention. Main outcome measures: Trial outcomes were metabolic syndrome (primary) and self-reported stress and depressive symptoms (secondary). Intervention effects were estimated in 2016 in an intention-to-treat framework using generalized estimating equations with adjustment for baseline level of the outcome and follow-up time points. Log-link Poisson generalized estimating equations with robust SEs was used to estimate prevalence ratios (PRs) for binary outcomes; mean differences were used for continuous/score outcomes. Results: Baseline prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 50.9\\% and depression was 11.4\\%. The 12-month intervention effect showed a beneﬁt for metabolic syndrome (PR¼0.86, 95\\% CI¼0.79, 0.94, po0.001). This beneﬁt was sustained at 24 months of intervention (PR¼0.88; 95\\% CI¼0.78, 1.00, p¼0.04). There was no signiﬁcant effect on depression or stress scores. Conclusions: The Spirited Life intervention improved metabolic syndrome prevalence in a population of U.S. Christian clergy and sustained improvements during 24 months of intervention. These ﬁndings offer support for long-duration behavior change interventions and population-level interventions that allow participants to set their own health goals.","tags":[],"title":"A 2-Year Holistic Health and Stress Intervention: Results of an RCT in Clergy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Timothy W.

This study adds to current knowledge by examining the impact of British Columbia’s Agricultural Land Reserve (ALR), established in 1973, which severely restricts subdivision and nonagricultural uses for more than 4.7 million hectares of farmland. To determine the extent to which the ALR preserves farmland by reducing or removing the development option, a multilevel hedonic pricing model is used to estimate the impact of land use, geographic, and zoning characteristics on farmland value near the capital city of Victoria on Vancouver Island. Using sales data from 1974 through 2008, the model demonstrates a changing ALR impact over time that varies considerably by improved and unimproved land types. In 2008, landowners paid 19\\% less for the typical improved farmland parcel within the ALR versus that outside it. This suggests that would-be developers expect permanency in the zoning law, and prefer non-ALR zoned land. However, ALR land that is unimproved has a premium of 55\\%, suggesting that this land is more valuable for agriculture than for development. Farmland located closer to the city or the commuting highway commands a premium if it has a residence on it, with a residence also explaining why smaller agricultural properties sell at higher prices. However, it appears that zoning by itself is insufﬁcient to protect farmland; other policies likely need to be implemented in conjunction with zoning to protect agricultural land.","tags":[],"title":"Farmland Protection and Agricultural Land Values at the Urban-Rural Fringe: British Columbia’s Agricultural Land Reserve","type":"publication"},{"authors":["D.

Contrary to this position, this research demonstrates that megachurches enjoy a long history in Protestantism. An important example from the 16th Century Huguenot architect Jacques Perret reveals an early Protestant vision for a large, multi-functional worship space. Soon after, this vision became realized in bricks and mortar. Revivalism and the Institutional Church Movement of the 19th and early 20th Centuries provide further connections between megachurches and the past. Revivalism provided the motivation for Protestants to go out and reach the masses, and the Institutional Church Movement provided the infrastructure to attract, convert, and nurture them. The demographic shifts that occurred following WWII led to the proliferation of churches in post-war America. This meant that large churches became increasingly visible, but journalists and social commentators mistook their increase in prevalence for lack of historical precedent. Pastors and other leaders, capitalizing on the appeal of innovation, reinforced this view.

Approximately half of this decline stems from the increase in the proportion of people reporting no religion, who, for the most part, do not attend religious services. The other portion of this decline is attributable to eroding attendance rates among Catholics, particularly older Catholics, and Protestants in Que´bec. Attendance rates for Protestants outside of Que´bec show signs of increase. The reported increase in weekly attendance in Canada by the Project Canada surveys and cited by Bibby as a possible indicator of a religious renaissance is revealed as an artifact in the data due to an oversample of Protestants.

We build on and extend this argument by focusing on intersecting group identities as a mechanism for identifying such incongruence, not only within religious contexts, but also at the intersection of categories such as gender and race. To illustrate this argument, the analysis draws on data from the 2006 Panel Study of American Religion and Ethnicity (PS-ARE) to assess how race, gender, and religion interact to produce different levels of attitude and behavior incongruencies on key issues of the day, speciﬁcally conservative social values and voting behaviors. The results ﬁnd marked differences and inconsistent relationships between attitudes and behaviors across racial-gender groups. We use the analysis to highlight the conditions that result in incongruence at the intersections of identity categories and pinpoint where social scientists are most vulnerable to committing the congruence fallacy.","tags":[],"title":"Intersecting Identities as a Source of Religious Incongruence","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Eagle"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1293840000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1293840000,"objectID":"64a2875617f67180eea2cd4cae0cc204","permalink":"/publication/2011-01-01_eagle_loosening_2011/","publishdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2011-01-01_eagle_loosening_2011/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"The Loosening Bond of Religion on Canadian Society: Reply to Bibby","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Eagle"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1262304000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1262304000,"objectID":"13a5cc097ad1ae72035a6870fddb54cb","permalink":"/publication/2010-01-01_eagle_pneumatological_2010/","publishdate":"2010-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2010-01-01_eagle_pneumatological_2010/","section":"publication","summary":"The debate surrounding the morality of homosexual marriage is one of the most charged and fractious in the church today. As local congregations, national denominations, and international affiliations of Christians wrestle with this issue, significant conflict and division has arisen and continues to rage. At the center of this debate are so-called “arguments from creation,” that is, arguments that look to the natural or revealed “order of things” to discern God’s design for appropriate sexual behavior. This mode of theological argumentation has a long history in the tradition of natural theology, which assumes that divine direction (and even divine speech) is inherent in creaturely capacities. In this article, I will demonstrate that New Testament scholarship is agreed that in Romans 1:18-32 (the key NT text on the issue), Paul is not making an argument per se against homosexuality. Instead, this passage fits within the larger claim that he is trying to make throughout the book of Romans about Jew-Gentile relations. What Paul condemns here is the human propensity to judge others based on supposedly intrinsic qualities. He is using a stereotypical Jewish understanding of Gentiles, and turning it back against those who would argue for some special innate characteristic within Jews that makes them special and within Gentiles that makes them depraved.","tags":[],"title":"Pneumatological Ecclesiology and Same-sex Marriage: A Non-essentialist Approach Using the Work of Eugene Rogers and John Zizioulas","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David E.

Mennonite theology, with its emphasis on a theology of peace, shares similar concerns. J. Denny Weaver takes issue with the dominance of the Anselmian satisfaction theory, particularly because of its inherent violence.1 In The Nonviolent Atonement, he articulates a view that “charts a path of nonviolent atonement through territory strewn with images and assumptions of violence.”2 He argues for narrative Christus Victor as a superior and inherently nonviolent atonement motif. However, I challenge Weaver’s claim. I contend that Mennonite theologians would find better resources for articulating a nonviolent approach in the work of Anthony Bartlett in his recent book, Cross Purposes: The Violent Grammar of Christian Atonement. Below I will raise questions about Weaver’s work and attempt to explain how Bartlett’s paradigm offers a better approach.","tags":[],"title":"Anthony Bartlett’s Concept of Abyssal Compassion and the Possibility of a Truly Nonviolent Atonement","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Welcome to Slides Academic\nFeatures  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides  Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E  Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = \\;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \nA fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears  Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view   Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links   night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links  Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/img/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?
