	abstract = {Are people less likely to attend large churches? Using nationally representative data, I find a negative relationship between size and the probability of attendance for Conservative, Mainline, and black Protestants and for Catholics in parishes larger than 500 attenders. The addition of control variables does not change these patterns. These results support the theory that group cohesion lies at the heart of the size-participation relationship in churches. With the rapid growth of megachurches in the United States, a negative relationship between size and frequency of attendance could serve to accelerate aggregate declines in attendance. Methodologically, this article demonstrates how Bayesian hierarchical models can handle complex data structures and imputation procedures in a unified model.},

	abstract = {Farmland conservation policies typically use zoning and differentiated taxes to prevent urban development of farmland, but little is known about the effectiveness of these policies. This study adds to current knowledge by examining the impact of British Columbia’s Agricultural Land Reserve (ALR), established in 1973, which severely restricts subdivision and nonagricultural uses for more than 4.7 million hectares of farmland. To determine the extent to which the ALR preserves farmland by reducing or removing the development option, a multilevel hedonic pricing model is used to estimate the impact of land use, geographic, and zoning characteristics on farmland value near the capital city of Victoria on Vancouver Island. Using sales data from 1974 through 2008, the model demonstrates a changing ALR impact over time that varies considerably by improved and unimproved land types. In 2008, landowners paid 19\% less for the typical improved farmland parcel within the ALR versus that outside it. This suggests that would-be developers expect permanency in the zoning law, and prefer non-ALR zoned land. However, ALR land that is unimproved has a premium of 55\%, suggesting that this land is more valuable for agriculture than for development. Farmland located closer to the city or the commuting highway commands a premium if it has a residence on it, with a residence also explaining why smaller agricultural properties sell at higher prices. However, it appears that zoning by itself is insufﬁcient to protect farmland; other policies likely need to be implemented in conjunction with zoning to protect agricultural land.},

	abstract = {The dominant view of megachurches claims they represent a new religious form, born in the United States in the 1970s and 80s. Contrary to this position, this research demonstrates that megachurches enjoy a long history in Protestantism. An important example from the 16th Century Huguenot architect Jacques Perret reveals an early Protestant vision for a large, multi-functional worship space. Soon after, this vision became realized in bricks and mortar. Revivalism and the Institutional Church Movement of the 19th and early 20th Centuries provide further connections between megachurches and the past. Revivalism provided the motivation for Protestants to go out and reach the masses, and the Institutional Church Movement provided the infrastructure to attract, convert, and nurture them. The demographic shifts that occurred following WWII led to the proliferation of churches in post-war America. This meant that large churches became increasingly visible, but journalists and social commentators mistook their increase in prevalence for lack of historical precedent. Pastors and other leaders, capitalizing on the appeal of innovation, reinforced this view. This research offers an important corrective that helps situate megachurches in the United States in their proper context.},

	abstract = {According to the General Social Survey, the combined rate of weekly and monthly attendance at religious services in Canada has declined by about 20 points from 1986 to 2008. Approximately half of this decline stems from the increase in the proportion of people reporting no religion, who, for the most part, do not attend religious services. The other portion of this decline is attributable to eroding attendance rates among Catholics, particularly older Catholics, and Protestants in Que´bec. Attendance rates for Protestants outside of Que´bec show signs of increase. The reported increase in weekly attendance in Canada by the Project Canada surveys and cited by Bibby as a possible indicator of a religious renaissance is revealed as an artifact in the data due to an oversample of Protestants. I ﬁnd another weighting problem in the Canadian Survey of Giving, Volunteering and Participating that leads to underestimates of aggregate religious attendance rates.},

To test this theory, we used survey data from the Clergy Health Initiative Panel Survey to examine the relationship between perceived and received social support and their association with depressive symptoms in clergy (N ¼ 1,288). Overall, analyses revealed perceived support had a weak association with received support. Greater perceived support had a significant relationship with lower depressive symptoms. In contrast, greater received support had only a small relationship with lower depressive symptoms, which was fully mediated by perceived support. Our results raise questions about the effectiveness of many clergy social support interventions, which often aim to boost the quality and/or quantity of received social support. We suggest it may be more advantageous to boost perceptions of social support, possibly through cognitive reframing or positive mental health interventions.},

Contrary to expectations, we ﬁnd that mental distress decreased for those who recently moved compared to those who had moved 2 years prior. We also ﬁnd strong evidence of a ‘‘honeymoon effect.’’ Recently relocated clergy report higher levels of self-efﬁcacy and higher workplace morale compared to those who do not relocate.

	abstract = {Introduction: This study sought to determine the effect of a 2-year, multicomponent health intervention (Spirited Life) targeting metabolic syndrome and stress simultaneously. Design: An RCT using a three-cohort multiple baseline design was conducted in 2010–2014. Setting/participants: Participants were United Methodist clergy in North Carolina, U.S., in 2010, invited based on occupational status. Of invited 1,745 clergy, 1,114 consented, provided baseline data, and were randomly assigned to immediate intervention (n¼395), 1-year waitlist (n¼283), or 2-year waitlist (n¼436) cohorts for a 48-month trial duration. Intervention: The 2-year intervention consisted of personal goal setting and encouragement to engage in monthly health coaching, an online weight loss intervention, a small grant, and three workshops delivering stress management and theological content supporting healthy behaviors. Participants were not blinded to intervention. Main outcome measures: Trial outcomes were metabolic syndrome (primary) and self-reported stress and depressive symptoms (secondary). Intervention effects were estimated in 2016 in an intention-to-treat framework using generalized estimating equations with adjustment for baseline level of the outcome and follow-up time points. Log-link Poisson generalized estimating equations with robust SEs was used to estimate prevalence ratios (PRs) for binary outcomes; mean differences were used for continuous/score outcomes.
Results: Baseline prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 50.9\% and depression was 11.4\%. The 12-month intervention effect showed a beneﬁt for metabolic syndrome (PR¼0.86, 95\% CI¼0.79, 0.94, po0.001). This beneﬁt was sustained at 24 months of intervention (PR¼0.88; 95\% CI¼0.78, 1.00, p¼0.04). There was no signiﬁcant effect on depression or stress scores.
Conclusions: The Spirited Life intervention improved metabolic syndrome prevalence in a population of U.S. Christian clergy and sustained improvements during 24 months of intervention. These ﬁndings offer support for long-duration behavior change interventions and population-level interventions that allow participants to set their own health goals.},

We build on and extend this argument by focusing on intersecting group identities as a mechanism for identifying such incongruence, not only within religious contexts, but also at the intersection of categories such as gender and race. To illustrate this argument, the analysis draws on data from the 2006 Panel Study of American Religion and Ethnicity (PS-ARE) to assess how race, gender, and religion interact to produce different levels of attitude and behavior incongruencies on key issues of the day, speciﬁcally conservative social values and voting behaviors. The results ﬁnd marked differences and inconsistent relationships between attitudes and behaviors across racial-gender groups. We use the analysis to highlight the conditions that result in incongruence at the intersections of identity categories and pinpoint where social scientists are most vulnerable to committing the congruence fallacy.},

	abstract = {The debate surrounding the morality of homosexual marriage is one of the
most charged and fractious in the church today. As local congregations,
national denominations, and international affiliations of Christians wrestle
with this issue, significant conflict and division has arisen and continues to
rage. At the center of this debate are so-called “arguments from creation,” that
is, arguments that look to the natural or revealed “order of things” to discern
God’s design for appropriate sexual behavior. This mode of theological
argumentation has a long history in the tradition of natural theology, which
assumes that divine direction (and even divine speech) is inherent in
creaturely capacities. In this article, I will demonstrate that New Testament
scholarship is agreed that in Romans 1:18-32 (the key NT text on the issue),
Paul is not making an argument per se against homosexuality. Instead, this
passage fits within the larger claim that he is trying to make throughout the
book of Romans about Jew-Gentile relations. What Paul condemns here is
the human propensity to judge others based on supposedly intrinsic qualities.
He is using a stereotypical Jewish understanding of Gentiles, and turning it
back against those who would argue for some special innate characteristic
within Jews that makes them special and within Gentiles that makes them
depraved.},

	abstract = {Congregations and other religious organizations are an important part of the social welfare system in the United States. This article uses data from the 2012 National Congregations Study to describe key features of congregational involvement in social service programs and projects. Most congregations (83\%), containing 92\% of religious service attendees, engage in some social or human service activities intended to help people outside of their congregation. These programs are primarily oriented to food, health, clothing, and housing provision, with less involvement in some of the more intense and long-term interventions such as drug abuse recovery, prison programs, or immigrant services. The median congregation involved in social services spent \$1500 per year directly on these programs, and 17\% had a staff member who worked on them at least a quarter of the time. Fewer than 2\% of congregations received any government ﬁnancial support of their social service programs and projects within the past year; only 5\% had applied for such funding. The typical, and probably most important, way in which congregations pursue social service activity is by providing small groups of volunteers to engage in well-deﬁned and bounded tasks on a periodic basis, most often in collaboration with other congregations and community organizations.},

	abstract = {Methods We compared the health of 1414 White and 93 Black clergy. Then, we used propensity scores to match Black and White participants on key socioeconomic, demographic, occupational, and physical activity characteristics and re-examined differences in health.
Results Prior to propensity score matching, Black clergy reported worse physical health than their White counterparts. They had greater body mass index, higher prevalence of diabetes and hypertension, and lower physical health functioning. White clergy reported less favorable mental health. They had higher severity of depression and anxiety symptoms as well as lower quality of life and mental health functioning. Propensity score analysis revealed that matching on SES and other key variables accounted for most, but not all, of the observed racial differences. Racial disparities in hypertension, depression severity, and mental health functioning persisted despite adjustments.
Conclusions Race contributed to health disparities in some outcomes in our study population, above and beyond our measures of participants’ present SES and key demographic, occupational, and physical activity variables. This study provides evidence supporting the position that race contributes to health disparities through pathways other than SES.},

	abstract = {Many theologians have recently argued that atonement theories related to the
Anselmian tradition introduce violent conflict into the very nature of God, which
effectively destroys God’s unity—a unity that is self-giving love. Mennonite
theology, with its emphasis on a theology of peace, shares similar concerns. J.
Denny Weaver takes issue with the dominance of the Anselmian satisfaction
theory, particularly because of its inherent violence.1 In The Nonviolent
Atonement, he articulates a view that “charts a path of nonviolent atonement
through territory strewn with images and assumptions of violence.”2 He argues
for narrative Christus Victor as a superior and inherently nonviolent atonement
motif. However, I challenge Weaver’s claim. I contend that Mennonite
theologians would find better resources for articulating a nonviolent approach
in the work of Anthony Bartlett in his recent book, Cross Purposes: The Violent
Grammar of Christian Atonement. Below I will raise questions about Weaver’s
work and attempt to explain how Bartlett’s paradigm offers a better approach.},
