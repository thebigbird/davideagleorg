### Biography

I am an Assistant Research Professor in the [Duke Global Health Institute](http://globalhealth.duke.edu) and a faculty affiliate at the [Center for Health Policy and Inequalities Research](http://www.chpir.org). In partnership with [Duke Divinity School](http://divinity.duke.edu), [Rae Jean Proeschold-Bell](https://globalhealth.duke.edu/people/proeschold-bell-rae-jean) and I help lead the [Duke Clergy Health Initiative](https://divinity.duke.edu/initiatives/clergy-health-initiative), a world leader in researching and designing interventions for pastors and religious leaders.

I am an expert on the health of religious clergy, the changing role of churches in North American society and the implications of these trends for the professional training of ministers. I have done significant work on burnout, depression and social support. A major strand of my research explores how structural racism impacts the experience of Black clergy.

I am Principle Investigator of [The Seminary to Early Ministry Study](http://semstudy.org), a multi-year, multi-cohort study seeking to understand how seminary impacts the health, occupational wellbeing, theology, and career trajectories of students.

Methodologically, I am skilled in the collection and analysis of survey data, including longitudinal and social network data. I am one of the lead methodologists on a large respondent-driven sampling project of sexual and gender minority populations in Kenya, Brazil and Vietnam.

My research is published in the Journal of Religion and Health, the Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, the Annals of Behavioral Medicine, the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, Social Networks, the Journal of Social History, the Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, and the Review of Religious Research.
